Here's a work in progress of a commissioned piece for sound of an art exhibition. Keywords of the brief were: 30 minutes, quiet, underwater.

Made it in two steps. Created a random blurb with the Plumbutter, fed into paul stretch with some harmonics added, that gave me 30 minutes of drone. That drone I fed into the gongues > ultrasound > plumbutter of the Plumbutter producing this weird noise. Added some more standard avdog and deerhorn sounds on the go. It's completely unprocessed, recorded straight from the Plumbutter and thus hard panned and full of static. Love this machine.
